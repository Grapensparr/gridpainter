# Getting Started

Before you follow these steps make sure you have node and git installed on your computer.

1. The easiest way to get started is to click the green "<> code" button and press "download as
   zip".
2. Open the project in a code editor (preferably Visual Studio Code).
3. Open the terminal and go to the root of the backend folder (e.g. via [cd backend]).
4. Then download all dependencies using npm install.
5. Do the same steps in the root of the frontend folder (switch with command [cd ..] then [cd
   frontend]).
6. Change filename ".env copy" to ".env" in the backend folder.
   
7. Now go to your backend folder and type [npm start] in your terminal (if you have nodemon
   installed globally).
8. If you don't have nodemon installed globally you have two options:

   1. Either install nodemon globally.
   2. Or go to package.json and change the line "start": "nodemon app.js" to: "start": "node app.js".

9. Navigate to the frontend folder via the terminal.
10. Type [npm run dev] and follow the link in the browser. Have fun!
